# soup_ladle
Short beautiful soup application to extract files from basic html webpages.
This simple web scraper was designed to extract snowstorm data from an NOAA index page: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/snowstorm-database/archive/.
The concept can be easily translated to other webpages of the same design.
